  Into the Light.
  This theme is WiP, a lot of things will be continually refined.

  HOW TO UPDATE / INSTALL


1. You need an iPod classic / video running Rockbox to apply the theme. Install Rockbox if you don't have it installed!

2. Plug in the iPod to get to its files.

3. On the IPOD, navigate to [.rockbox] folder. You might need to [show hidden files] to see this folder. (if on a mac, hit [⌘⇧.] to toggle hidden files.)

4. THIS folder you downloaded also contains a [.rockbox] folder. Merge its contents into the [.rockbox] folder on the iPod, making sure to place the files in the right folders. If updating, replace / delete any previous files or folders from older versions of this theme.

5. Eject the iPod once all files are in place.

6. On the iPod, boot into Rockbox and head to the theme settings to select the theme (or if updating, re-select).

7. Enjoy!

  NOTES:


I'm using methods that push Rockbox themeing to the absolute edge, so Rockbox can react strangely sometimes. It's fairly stable for me but in order to get the look as shown, many themeing "methods" were exploited to get here. You may notice flickery transitions or glitchy borders, but these should clear out quickly after appearing.

- When first loading the theme you may notice some glitchy borders. To remove this, hold menu then exit the QuickScreen. The glitchy effect should disappear.

- On boot, you might also see this glitchy effect, this should disappear shortly after boot.

- Read the TIPS file included in the install pack to learn a few nifty Rockbox tricks.
